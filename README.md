# Computer Vision stuff 

All CV-related stuff, including deep learning benchmarks, and CV for indoor mapping, object-detection and navigation.

### 01. Benchmarks ### 

See [BENCHMARK.md](https://github.com/SkinnyRat/CV-Stuff/blob/master/BENCHMARK.md). Convolutional neural network training with TensorFlow and Caffe2 for MNIST and CIFAR10 on ImageNet (yep I know, not the best idea). 

Speed & accuracy benchmarked for GTX 1050, GTX 1060, GTX 1080Ti, and 2x GTX 1080Ti GPUs.
